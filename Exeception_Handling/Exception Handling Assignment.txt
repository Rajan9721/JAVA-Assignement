                                                          Exception handling Assignment 


Q1) Explain different types of error in java.
Ans) =>>
There are three type of error in java.
    a) Syntax Error.
    b) Logical Error.
    c) Runtime Error.
     a) Syntax Error or Complie Time error.=>>
        Compile Time Errors are those errors which prevent the code from running because of an incorrect syntax such 
        as a missing semicolon at the end of a statement or a missing bracket, class not found, etc. 
        These errors are detected by the java compiler and an error message is displayed on the screen while compiling. 
        Compile Time Errors are sometimes also referred to as Syntax errors

     b) Logical Error.
        Logical Error: A logic error is when your program compiles and executes, 
        but does the wrong thing or returns an incorrect result or no output when it should be returning an output. 
        These errors are detected neither by the compiler nor by JVM. 
        The Java system has no idea what your program is supposed to do, 
        so it provides no additional information to help you find the error. Logical errors are also called Semantic Errors. 
        These errors are caused due to an incorrect idea or concept used by a programmer while coding. 

     c) Runtime Error:=>>
        Run Time errors occur or we can say, are detected during the execution of the program. 
        Sometimes these are discovered when the user enters an invalid data or data which is not relevant. 
        Runtime errors occur when a program does not contain any syntax errors but asks the computer to do something that 
        the computer is unable to reliably do. 
        During compilation, the compiler has no technique to detect these kinds of errors. 
        It is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that detects it while the program is running

Q2) What is an Exception in Java?
Ans) =>>
 Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run time, 
 that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. 
 When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object. 
 It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the 
 program when the exception occurred.

Q3) How can you handle exceptions in java? Explain with example.

Ans) =>>

 We can handle exception by using five keywords 
 1) try: 	    The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. 
                It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.

 2) catch: 	    The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. 
                It can be followed by finally block later.

 3) finally:	The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.

 4) throw:	    The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.

 5) throws: 	The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. 
                It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used with method signature.


Q4) Why do we need exception handling in java?

Ans) =>>
    Java Exception handling is used to handle runtime errors only. 
    The compile-time errors have to be fixed by the developer writing the code else the program won’t execute.

Q5) What is the difference bitween exception and error in java?

Ans) =>>
    Exception:- 
     a) Exception can be recovered by using the try-catch block. An error cannot be recovered.
     b)	It can be classified into two categories i.e. checked and unchecked.	
	 c) It occurs at compile time or run time.	
     d)	It belongs to java.lang.Exception package.	
     e)	Only checked exceptions are known to the compiler.	
     f)	It is mainly caused by the application itself.	
        Example of exception:	Checked Exceptions: SQLException, IOException
                                Unchecked Exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException, ArithmaticException.
    Error:- 
     a) An error cannot be recovered.
     b) All errors in Java are unchecked.
     c) It occurs at run time.
     d) It belongs to java.lang.Error package.
     e) Errors will not be known to the compiler.
     f) It is mostly caused by the environment in which the application is running.
        Example of error: Java.lang.StackOverFlow, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

Q6) Name of the different type of exception in java.

Ans) =>>
 1) Built-in Exceptions
    Checked Exception
    Unchecked Exception
 2) User-Defined Exceptions
  a) Checked Exception:
       IOException:
            EOFException
            FileNotFoundException
            InterruptIOException
        ClassNotFoundException
        InterruptedException
        SQLException
        AWTException
  b) Unchecked Exception
      RuntimeException:
        ArithmeticException
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
        ClasspointException
        NullPointerException
